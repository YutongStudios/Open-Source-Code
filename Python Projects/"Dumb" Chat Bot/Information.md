This is a "dumb" chat bot.

This is not AI, it has a list of potential things a user may say to it, and a preset response to those things.

How it works:
1. Runs through the output.
2. Asks the user to input a message.
3. Check if the message is on the list of possible things a user might say.
4. If it is on the list, print the preset response.
5. If it is not on the list, respond with "I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying."
