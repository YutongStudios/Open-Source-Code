This battleship is **very** basic.

How it works:
1. Runs through the output.
2. Ships are placed in randomized locations.
3. Asks the user for a row and column (between 0 and 9).
4. If it hits a ship, "You hit a ship!" is displayed while misses show "You missed."
5. If a shink is sunk, it displays "You sunk a ship of length shipLength!"
6. Once all ships are sunk, it displays "You sank all ships in shotsTaken shots."
